[Hamlbars](https://github.com/jamesotron/hamlbars) is a Ruby gem which allows you to easily generate [Handlebar](http://handlebarsjs.com) templates using [Haml](http://www.haml-lang.com).

# Attribute bindings

You can easily add attribute bindings by adding a `:bind` hash to the tag attributes, like so:

    %div{ :class => 'widget', :bind => { :title => 'App.widgetController.title' }

Which will generate the following output:

    <div class="widget" {{bindAttr title="App.widgetController.title"}}></div>

# Event bindings

You can add one or more event actions by adding an event hash or array or event hashes to the tag options:

    %a{ :event => { :on => 'click', :action => 'clicked' } } Click

or

    %div{ :events => [ { :on => 'mouseover', :action => 'highlightView' }, { :on => 'mouseout', :action => 'disableViewHighlight' } ] }

Note that the default event is `click`, so it's not necessary to specify it:

    %a{ :event => { :action => 'clicked' } } Click

# Handlebar helper

You can use the `handlebars` helper (or just `hb` for short) to generate both Handlebar blocks and expressions.

## Expressions

Generating Handlebars expressions is as simple as using the `handlebars` helper and providing the expression as a string argument:

    = hb 'App.widgetController.title'

which will will generate:

    {{App.widgetController.title}}

## Blocks

Whereas passing a block to the `handlebars` helper will create a Handlebars block expression:

    %ul.authors
    = hb 'each authors' do
      %li<
	= succeed ',' do
	  = hb 'lastName'
	= hb 'firstName'

will result in the following markup:

    <ul class="authors">
       {{#each authors}}
         <li>{{lastName}}, {{firstName}}</li>
       {{/each}}
    </ul>

## Options

The `hb` helper can take an optional hash of options which will be rendered inside the expression:

    = hb 'view App.InfoView', :tagName => 'span'

will result in:

    {{view App.InfoView tagName="span"}}

## Tripple-stash

You can use the `handlebars!` or `hb!` variant of the `handlebars` helper to output "tripple-stash" expressions within which Handlebars does not escape the output.

# Configuring template output:

`hamlbars` has three configuration options, which pertain to the generated JavaScript:

    Hamlbars::Template.template_destination    # default 'Handlebars.templates'
    Hamlbars::Template.template_compiler       # default 'Handlebars.compile'
    Hamlbars::Template.template_partial_method # default 'Handlebars.registerPartial'

These settings will work find by default if you are using Handlebars as a standalone JavaScript library, however if you are using something that embeds Handlebars within it then you'll have to change these.

If you're using [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com) then you can use:

    Hamlbars::Template.render_templates_for :ember

Which is effectively the same as:

    Hamlbars::Template.template_destination = 'Ember.TEMPLATES'
    Hamlbars::Template.template_compiler = 'Ember.Handlebars.compile'
    Hamlbars::Template.template_partial_method = 'Ember.Handlebars.registerPartial'

The good news is that if you're using the [emberjs-rails](http://www.rubygems.org/gems/emberjs-rails) gem then it will automatically detect hamlbars and change it for you. Magic!

If you're using [ember-rails](http://rubygems.org/gems/ember-rails) then you'll need to put this in a initializer.

# Configuring JavaScript output:

As of version 2012.3.21 `hamlbars` has experimental support for template precompilation using [ExecJS](http://rubygems.org/gems/execjs).  If you want to enable this support you can use:

    Hamlbars::Template.enable_precompiler!

You can also disable enclosification (which is enabled by default) using:

    Hamlbars::Template.disable_closures!

# Asset pipeline

Hamlbars is specifically designed for use with Rails 3.1's asset pipeline.  Simply create templates ending in `.js.hamlbars` and Sprockets will know what to do.

# Rails helpers

You can enable support by calling `Hamlbars::Template.enable_rails_helpers!`. Probably the best way to do this is to create an initializer.  This is dangerous and possibly stupid as a large number of Rails' helpers require access to the request object, which is not present when compiling assets.

**Use at your own risk. You have been warned.**
